# Asteroids game
This is a little game in pygame about a spaceship shooting up some rocks.
The visuals are pretty abstract, but it was a nice first foray into doing a
big(ger) project in python.

This was also the second project of my learning path on boot.dev. Go check them
out!

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add a scoring system
